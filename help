The script is built for Artix Dinit installation.

The Artix ISO has to be Dinit version to fit the installation process.
1. The script supports Dinit only.
2. 

Please, before using the script make sure that:

1. The Artix ISO is Dinit version.
2. The system supports UEFI boot.
4. 
3. You're OK with using three paritions for the system (Boot, Swap, Root).

Otherwise, rewrite the script for your needs.

By default, the script does:

The script installs the Dinit version of Artix. It supposes that the hardware supports UEFI and x64 architecture. It uses three partitions: Boot, Swap, and Root. 

1. It's built for Dinit version installation of Artix;
2. It supposes the hardware's support of UEFI and x64 architecture;
3. It supposes the system's consistance of three partitions: Boot, Swap, and Root;
4. It formats Boot to FAT32, Swap to EXT4, and Root partition to BTRFS;
5. It creates and uses BTRFS subvolumes `/@` and `/@snapshots`;
4. It installs NVIDIA (Turing, NV160/TUXXX) open source drivers;
5. Installs


It installs Dinit version of Artix. It's supposed that the hardware supports UEFI and x64 architecture. Initially, it's built to work with three partitions: Boot (formats to FAT32), Swap (to EXT4), and Root (BTRFS). It's also able to create `/@` and `/@snapshots` subvolumes and take a snapshot right after the installation by choice. 

There are features that might be configured with the script's interface: partitions paths, BTRFS usage, packages to install,  

but if you want more, feel free to overwrite it for your specific needs.

The script installs Dinit version of Artix for x64-bit systems with UEFI support. Initially, it's forced to work with three partitions: Boot, Swap, Root (paths can be specified). And formats them to FAT32, EXT4, and BTRFS accordingly. Along with this, it creates subvolumes `/@` for Root and `/@snapshots` for the further snapshots storing. After the installation, it can automatically take a snapshot of the fresh system.




It supposes the following conditions:

1. Artix Dinit version.
2. A motherboard with UEFI support.
3. The target drive's partitioning: Boot, Swap, Root.
